# GradeCalculatorPlus
 Calculating grades with extra features for the most ðŸš€studiosðŸš€ students
 
### What can it do?
- Calculate the lowest possible grade you can get on an assignment instead of working on the assignment (average AP student)
- Analyze the possibilities of different outcomes with EOC grades on your assignments
- Automatically navigate to Infinite Campus for you so you can how bad you messed up
- ~~Do your work for you~~ It actually can't its never that easy and you should've actually done the assignment man
### How can I run this epic software?
1. Remember to create a login.txt file in the same directory as the run.py script
2. Check that the chromedriver.exe file is in the same directory as the run.py script. If you don't have it check your Chrome version and download the correct chrome driver for it here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
3. "python run.py"
### What technologies does this use?
- Selenium webdriver
- Thats the only unique one to be honest the rest of them come pre-installed with python
